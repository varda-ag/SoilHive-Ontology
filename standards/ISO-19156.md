# ISO 19156:2023 â€” Observations and Measurements

## Overview

ISO 19156:2023 provides a framework for the **representation of observations and measurements** related to geographic and environmental data. This standard is essential for defining how observational data is collected, described, and shared in a consistent and interoperable manner.

## Key Aspects

- **Observational Models**: Specifies a structured model for recording observations, measurements, and samples.
- **Geospatial Integration**: Integrates observations into geospatial systems, making it easier to analyze spatially distributed data.
- **Applications**: Widely used in fields like environmental monitoring, agriculture, and meteorology to standardize data collection and sharing.
