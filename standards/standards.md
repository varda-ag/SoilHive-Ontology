# Standards Used in the SoilHive Ontology

The SoilHive project adheres to a range of international standards to ensure interoperability, consistency, and accuracy in representing soil-related data. These standards help define key concepts, methodologies, and best practices for data management, exchange, and observation.

The following ISO standards are particularly important for SoilHive:

- **ISO 28258:2013** — Digital exchange of soil-related data
- **ISO 19156:2023** — Observations and measurements for geospatial information

Each standard plays a critical role in defining how soil data is structured, stored, and exchanged in an interoperable manner. Below, you'll find more detailed descriptions of the key standards used in our ontology work.

For a more detailed look at the standards, refer to their respective pages:

- [ISO 28258:2013](ISO-28258.md)
- [ISO 19156:2023](ISO-19156.md)
