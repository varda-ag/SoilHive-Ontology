# ISO 28258:2013 â€” Digital Exchange of Soil-Related Data

## Overview

ISO 28258:2013 specifies a standard for the **digital exchange of soil-related data**. The goal of this standard is to enable consistent and interoperable communication of soil data between systems. It covers a range of soil attributes, including physical, chemical, and biological properties, as well as how this data is shared in digital form.

## Key Aspects

- **Data Structure**: Defines how soil data should be structured for effective exchange.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures that soil-related datasets can be shared and understood across different systems and platforms.
- **Applications**: Used in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and land use management to facilitate the exchange of soil data.
