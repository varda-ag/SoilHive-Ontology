# SoilHive Ontology Repository

Welcome to the SoilHive Ontology Repository! This repository is part of the Global Soil Program and is focused on developing an ontology to support the SoilHive product. Our goal is to build an interconnected system of ontologies that describe various aspects of soil data, integrating both external and internally developed ontologies.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to define, extend, and integrate various soil-related ontologies. Our base ontology is the **GloSIS Soil Ontology**, but we have identified gaps that will be filled using other existing ontologies and custom-built ontologies.

This repository is structured as follows:

- A collection of ontologies that are integrated into the SoilHive system.
- A set of custom ontology snippets we develop to address missing concepts.
- Documentation of each ontology and its role in the system.
- Examples on how to map some of the datasources integrated in SoilHive (LUCAS, HWSDv2, WoSIS) to the collection of ontologies metioned above.

## Ontology Overview

The SoilHive ontology builds upon multiple external standards and ontologies to ensure interoperability and coverage across various sub-domains of soil science. Some of these ontologies include **ISO standards**, **AGROVOC**, **GloSIS**, and others.

For more detailed information on the specific ontologies, their usage, and the missing concepts we aim to address, see [ontology-details.md](ontology-details.md).

## Standards

SoilHive adheres to key ISO standards to ensure the interoperability and reliability of soil-related data exchange. For more information on the standards we use, visit the [standards.md](standards/standards.md) file, which includes details on each standard and how they are applied.
