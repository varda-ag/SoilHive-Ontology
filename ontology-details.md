## Custom Ontologies

In addition to using existing ontologies, we will also create several custom snippets to fill specific gaps. This includes:

- **Global Field ID**: A custom ontology for tracking and managing global field identifiers.
- **Water Management**: Custom ontology extensions to capture water management practices relevant to soil data.
- **Other Soil-related Ontologies**: As we identify additional gaps in existing ontologies, we will create new components to fill these needs.
