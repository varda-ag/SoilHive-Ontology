# Contributing to the SoilHive Ontology Project

The aim of this repository is to build a collaborative consensus around guidelines for using and extending ontologies for soil-related data within the SoilHive product. We encourage the community to actively participate by offering improvements, clarifying existing guidelines, and suggesting extensions to address new concepts or data needs. Contributions can take many forms, including:

- Proposing and discussing ideas via [GitHub issues](#) for enhancements or clarifications.
- Implementing new features or updates by modifying the ontology documentation and updating relevant architectural decisions.
- Submitting a Pull Request to initiate a review of the changes and collaborate on refining the implementation.

We value the contributions from the community and look forward to your participation!
